üöÄ My Express.js Backend Development learning curve! üöÄ

Are you looking to streamline your database interactions in Express.js applications? Look no further! Let me introduce you to Sequelize ORM - a game-changer for backend development!

üîç What is Sequelize ORM?
Sequelize is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, designed to simplify database interactions in Express.js applications. It provides a seamless interface for performing CRUD operations, defining models, handling associations, and executing complex queries - all using JavaScript syntax!

üí° Why Should You Use Sequelize in Your Express.js Projects?

1. Simplicity: Say goodbye to complex SQL queries! With Sequelize, you can interact with your database using intuitive JavaScript methods, making your code more readable and maintainable.

2. Cross-Database Compatibility: Whether you're using MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MSSQL, Sequelize has got you covered! Its support for multiple database dialects allows you to switch databases effortlessly without rewriting your code.

3. Model-Driven Development: Define models to represent your database tables, enforce validation rules, and establish relationships between entities. Sequelize's model-driven approach promotes code organization and reusability, leading to more efficient development workflows.

Things to concider

1. in your mysql database table
   must have fields : id: auto increment,
   createdAt:Date,
   updatedAt:Date

2. By default, when the table name is not given, Sequelize automatically pluralizes the model name and uses that as the table name.
   example "Users" instade of "users"
